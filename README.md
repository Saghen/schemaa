# 🚀 schemaa
A fast, lightweight and flexible schema-based verifier and sanitizer. The goal of the project is to provide a validation system that can be used widely across SQL and NoSQL databases, incoming requests, outgoing requests, and more. 

# 📝 Project Goals
- Works across Node and Browser
- Simple implementation (No behind the scenes magic)
- Lightweight <-- <5kb gzipped
- Fast
- Minimal nesting and boilerplate
- Testable
- Plugin system for conversion between various schemas (Mongoose, Sequelize, etc)

The developers using the library should be able to write one extensible and simple schema that can be converted to Mongoose while also being able to validate incoming requests, form data, and any other form of data.
